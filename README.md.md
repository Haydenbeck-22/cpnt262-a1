Initially I made the toggle feature by using a function and just running it with an Onclick event attached to the button, however I read in the assignment instructions that we're supposed to use document.addEventListener so I changed it to use that instead. I added some styling to the button in order to make it appear clickable as well, however I think I could do with some practice on my css skills.
